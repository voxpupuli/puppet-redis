# Redis class for configuring ulimit
# Used to DRY up the config class, and
# move the logic for ulimit changes all
# into one place.
#
# Parameters are not required as it's a
# private class only referencable from
# the redis module, where the variables
# would already be defined
#
# @example
#   contain redis::ulimit
